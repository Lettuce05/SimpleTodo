# SimpleTodo

A minimal yet fully featured todo list. [Live](https://simpletodo.anthonyromaine.com/)

NOTE: Styles have only been tested on Firefox and Chrome

This project aims to go beyond the usual basic todo project. In addition to basic todo list functionality, it features:
- Persistence (via Local Storage)
- Editing todo text and list
- Multiple lists

## Persistence

What good is a todo list if you are unable to come back to your todos.

## Editing

The editing feature allows you to change the text of the todo, and change the list that the todo is on.

## Multiple Lists

The multiple lists feature allows you to create multiple lists, move todos between lists, and delete lists. On the home list you are able to view all of your todos from every list. Each todo has a color to indicate which list it belongs to. This feature also adds the ability to view how many uncompleted todos you have left in each list. This is indicated by the number on the right side of list option in the navigation bar.
